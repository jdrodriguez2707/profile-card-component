### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Font library

### What I learned

- How to avoid scrolling when using background images larger than the viewport:

```css
body {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

- How to avoid scrolling on mobile devices only by using a meta tag:

```html
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"
/>
```

### Continued development

- CSS Grid
- Responsive design
- Work with background images and avoid scrolling

### Useful resources

- [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) - This helped me check the markup validity in my HTML document.
- [The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - This helped me validate my CSS style sheet.
